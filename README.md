# HyConSys Presentation Latex Template (v0.1)

This is a Latex template for talks given by the members of HyConSys Lab (http://www.hyconsys.com).

## Title Logo

To replace title's frame background,  replace the file (hyconsys-resources/figures/HyConSys_Logo_RGB.jpg) with whatever image you like (use same extension and name).

## Title Background

The current image put as a background is a dummy image (actually, it is the same image used for the logo). It just shows you the placeholder of the background image so that you know about it and change it if you like to have a background image. To change title's frame background, replace the file (hyconsys-resources/figures/HyConSys_Background.jpg) with whatever image you like (use same extension and name). To remove the background, comment the line:

    \includegraphics{hyconsys-resources/images/HyConSys_Background.jpg}

in the (hyconsys-presentation.cls) file.


## References

Add references to the file (refs.bib) or refer to your own file by changing the file name in the (talk.tex) file.
